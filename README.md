BLOCKCHAIN – HELATHCARE DATA MANAGMENT
/n
Healthcare data generally contains sensitive and crucial data of patients. This data is regularly 
shared among different specialists like doctor, radiologist , pharmacists etc. In India, the 
government has released a draft policy on HealthCare data management to protect the citizens’ 
data. A patient’s personal health information is considered as sensitive data (SPDI) under the 
IT Rules (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or 
Information)2011. It is accorded higher protection than other personal data. A recent judgement 
by a state high court stated that “there is a need to ensure that there is no data epidemic after 
the Covid-19 epidemic is controlled.”
Currently most users healthcare data is in an unstructured format and in paper mode. Hospitals 
continue to follow traditional procedures for maintaining patient health records. This makes it 
difficult for both the patient and the healthcare providers to refer the data or prescriptions when 
needed. Interaction between different departments on a patient’s data also gets difficult. This 
problem can be solved by maintaining the data as healthcare records digitally. Each record - a 
systemized collection of the patient’s details. But maintaining this data in centralized manner 
can lack in interoperability and increase security concerns.
The records controlled by healthcare providers in their respective central databases. The 
databases are prone to hacking and other injection attacks. Therefore there is great chance of 
security breaches if data is stored in centralized databases. A healthcare data blockchain system 
can provide a safer, more transparent, and traceable system for health information exchange. 
The technology has the potential to connect multiple data management systems. Information 
can be stored on the blockchain and can be seamlessly accessed by patients and healthcare 
providers in any place. With blockchain, healthcare data can be stored immutably in a 
decentralized manner instead of storing in one database. As a result, there would be no single 
point of entry for a hacker to retrieve the data.
In this paper we present the implementation of SHA 1 algorithm to produce message digests, 
which is used as a hashing algorithm between the blocks.

We have implemented the SHA1 hashing algorithm using JAVA and have tested the result 
obtained with that of an online SHA1 hash calculator.
The SHA1 algorithm takes an input of variable length and produces an output of 160-bits 
hash(40 digits) known as the message digest.
